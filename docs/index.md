# sipgate Developer

## Integrate telephony into everything!

We opened up our telephony systems for you to build integrations and get the most out of it.

## [REST API](rest-api/authentication.md)

We build our applications using this API and we invite you to use it too.

[Check out the official documentation.][rest-api]

## [Push API][push-api]

sipgate.io passes call meta data to your web server in real-time.

[Check out the official documentation.][push-api]

## [XML-RPC API][xml-rpc-api]

Way back in 2005 we released our first API called SAMURAI. The API is still usable but no longer under active development. We advise you to use our [REST API][rest-api] instead. 

[Check out the XML-RPC API specification.][xml-rpc-api]
