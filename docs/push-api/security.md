# A word about security

## HTTP vs. HTTPS

We strongly encourage you to use a HTTPS server. Although we support plain HTTP connections we do not recommend pushing sensitive call details over unencrypted connections. Be aware that sipgate.io does not accept [self-signed certificates](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10176685). If you need a certificate for your server, you can easily get one at [LetÂ´s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
